Keep your interface specifications Spectacular!

Spectacular helps to make the change review process for interface specifications more visible and organised, resulting in the healthier evolution of interfaces. Ultimately fostering an "API First" culture.

## Key Features
* Integration with GitHub for user login and access control to your interface spec files
* Ability to organise your interface spec files into "Catalogues", making them easier to find
* Visualising your interface specifications using graphical documentation tools like [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) for OpenAPI files
* Easier tracking of open change proposals for an interface by showing all the open Pull Requests in one place
